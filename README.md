# Lizard

A Markdown note taker. C++ implementation. I did this project first in Python with PyQt5, but decide to rebuild it with Qt Creator in C++. I use this editor for note taking during class. Also, it was a way to discover the Qt library and practice my C++ skills.

## Prerequisites

I recommend having **Qt Creator** installs on your machine. Then simply open the *.pro* file.

You can also build the binary with the help of the **Makefile**. However, make sure to install all dependencies.

## Installing
The current **Makefile** doesn't have an install command yet. Simply call **make** to build the binay in the **bin** folder.
